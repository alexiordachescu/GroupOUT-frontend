# GroupOUT - An online social platform for friends 👥 

Dear visitor, first of all thanks for taking the time to check out my project. My name is Alex and I'm a newbie but motivated developer and this is my portfolio project. The next (sub-)chapters will dive you into my 2 weeks progress. 

### `What is GroupOUT ?` 🧑🏿‍🤝‍🧑 

GroupOUT is an application for people or groups of people interested in socializing and creating new friends. The main purpose of this web application is to stimulate real-life encounters between groups of people. Whenever one feels lonely, bored or his / her friends unexpectedly cancel a meeting, they can check out the "Explore groups" page of this app. Or even better, they can use the "Create group" feature to make sure their initial well established schedule goes as planned.

### `Project goals` 🎯

The purpose of building this project in less than 2 weeks was a dual one. On one hand to include and practice all the learned technologies during the Codaisseur bootcamp and on the other hand to explore, document, and familiarize with new concepts such as Material-UI (frontend) and many-to-many relationships (on the backend side).    

- Create a React app
- Setup a project layout by means of wireframes, database models and project boards
- Apply what I've learned in Codaisseur's bootcamp 
- Independently explore new frameworks and look more into them  
- Practice appropiate version control usage like branching & clear commit messages 
- Practice the full-stack web development cycle 

### `Technologies used within this project` ⚙️ 

- React
- Redux 
- Axios 
- Material-UI 
- NodeJS 
- Express 
- REST APIs 
- Sequelize ORM 
- Database relationships: one-to-many & many-to-many 

### `User Stories` 🎬

- As a visitor, I want to check out the details of all available groups looking for new members. However, I must login in order to join these. 
- As a logged in user, I’d like to filter or look for groups which suit my interests. 
- As a logged in user, I want to be able to join these groups. 
- As a logged in user, I want to have an overview of the groups I'm currently part of.  
- As a logged in user, I want to be able to post a new group on the feed in order to “recruit” members. 
- As a logged in user, I want to ensure that the existing members still want to go out so there is a discussion going on on the group page.  
- As a logged in user, I want to be able to change my personal details. 
- As a group creator, I want to have access to the group details and the users list so I can keep it clean and updated.
